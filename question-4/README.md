## Question 4: Student BST
- Features:
  * BST implementation for student records
  * Search by last name
  * Inorder traversal for sorted output
- Time Complexity:
  * Search: O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case
  * Insertion: O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case
- BST vs Binary Tree:
  * BST maintains ordering property
  * Efficient searching (O(log n) vs O(n))
  * Self-balancing variants available
- BST vs Linear Search:
  * BST: O(log n) search time
  * Linear: O(n) search time
  * BST better for frequent searches
- Compile: `gcc student_bst.c -o student_bst`
- Run: `./student_bst`
